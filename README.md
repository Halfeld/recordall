### How to install

You just need enable developer mode on extension page, and upload `app` folder, But if you still can not install it, I'll make a video showing how to install and use it ;)

### To-do

+ [ ] Support mp4.
+ [ ] Record audio as well.
+ [ ] Break into more components and add Vuex.
+ [ ] When will save the note, ability to discard as well.
+ [ ] Create a settings tab (already exists the component).
+ [ ] Create a timer, to start recording.
+ [x] Show how much time has already been recorded.
+ [ ] Add tests.

See this changes on [developer branch](https://github.com/Halfeld/recordall/tree/develop).
